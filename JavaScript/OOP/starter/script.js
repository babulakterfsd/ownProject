all the object that are created from the constructor function will inherit . so they will get access to all the methods and properties that are defines on this prototype property.

one more question where does this __proto__  propertry on the matlida object actually come from. well remember the new operator  it containes the step number three(line 7)
so it creates the __proto__ property and it set it's value to the prototype propertry of the function that has been called. so that is exactly written in line 63
so it set the __proto__ property on the object to the prototype propertry of the constructor function and this is how javascript knows internally that the matlida object is connected to
Person.prototype

The difference between __proto__ and prototype
prototype

1. Each function in JS will automatically have an property called prototype, which includes constructor function

2. prorotype is an property in (constructor) function which contains all the stuff that that will be inherited by it's instance

3. Every object created by a constructor function will be able to get access to all the methods and properties that define on the prototype property of the constructor function

4. By this way, we don't need to set the method on every object. Instead, we only set the method once on the prototype of constructor function. Then all the object created by this constructor function will have access to that method



__proto__

1. Every object in JS will have a property called __proto__

2. The __proto__ property of object is essentially the prototype property of the constructor function that create the object

3. In other words, __proto__ of object is as same as prototype of function which create that object



Let's review the code in this lecturer

const Person = function (firstName, birthYear) {
  this.firstName = firstName;
  this.birthYear = birthYear;
};
First, we create a constructor function called Person.

At this time, the prototype of this function has nothing (not indeed empty actually)

console.log(Person.prototype);


Then, we create a method on the prototype of Person

Person.prototype.calcAge = function () {
  console.log(2037 - this.birthYear);
};
Break it down a little bit

1.  Person is a constructor function

2. "prototype" is one of the property in the Person constructor function

3.  then we define a method called calcAge on that "prototype" property

4.  All the object(instance) created by Person constructor function will inheirt it's prototype

5. So that object(instance) can have access to this method .calcAge()

6. "this" point to the object calling the method



Now, the prototype of the Person function will have a function called calcAge: Æ’ ()

console.log(Person.prototype);


Later, we call the Person function with "new" to create an object

const jonas = new Person('Jonas', 1990);
Now, jonas is an object created by Person function. So the __proto__ property of jonas object will inherit from (link to) prototype property of Person function



So, if you do these two lines of code

console.log(Person.prototype); // see the prototype of Person (constructor function)


console.log(Object.getPrototypeOf(jonas)); // see the __proto__ of object


You will see the output of these two lines of code are actually same



And also can be proved by this line of code

console.log(Person.prototype === Object.getPrototypeOf(jonas)); // true


I'm just a student like you, so I wouldn't say I'm 100% correct. Just wanna show what I learn from this course so far. Hope this will help you a little bit.

/*Coding Challenge #1
Your tasks:
1. Use a constructor function to implement a 'Car'. A car has a 'make' and a
'speed' property. The 'speed' property is the current speed of the car in
km/h
2. Implement an 'accelerate' method that will increase the car's speed by 10,
and log the new speed to the console
3. Implement a 'brake' method that will decrease the car's speed by 5, and log
the new speed to the console
4. Create 2 'Car' objects and experiment with calling 'accelerate' and
'brake' multiple times on each of them
Test data:
Â§ Data car 1: 'BMW' going at 120 km/h
Â§ Data car 2: 'Mercedes' going at 95 km/h
GOOD LUCK ï¿½*/
